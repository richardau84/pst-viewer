# PST Viewer

A fast, private, **fully in-browser** viewer for Outlook **`.pst` / `.ost`** mailboxes and standalone **`.msg` / `.eml`** messages (and `.zip` archives containing them). Everything runs locally on your device: no server, no Python, no build tools to install for end users, and **nothing is ever uploaded**.

Installable as an offline app (PWA): load the site once and it keeps working with no internet.

## Use it now

**Live app: https://bod09.github.io/pst-viewer/**

No setup needed. Open the link, drop in a `.pst`, `.ost`, `.msg`, `.eml`, or `.zip`, and start reading. Nothing is uploaded; everything runs in your browser (see [Privacy](#privacy)). If you would rather run or host it yourself, see [Run it](#run-it) and [Deploy](#deploy).

## Features

- **Open** `.pst`, `.ost`, `.msg`, `.eml`, and `.zip` files (zips are scanned automatically for mailboxes and messages, including nested ones), by drag-and-drop or browse. Standalone `.msg`/`.eml` files dropped together are grouped into one mailbox, sorted into Outlook-like folders by type (Messages, Contacts, Calendar, Tasks, Notes), and `.msg`/`.eml` files attached to an email open inline like any other message. Password-protected mailboxes open too: an Outlook PST password gates Outlook's own UI, not the data, so none is needed to read the mailbox here.
- **Multiple mailboxes** at once, with smart auto-labels and inline rename.
- **1:1 email viewing**: full HTML rendering (and RTF-encapsulated HTML) with inline images, in a sandboxed frame. Remote images load like a normal mail client, with invisible tracking pixels (1x1 / hidden images) stripped. **Click any image to view it full screen**, then zoom to actual size and drag to pan. A **Headers** button shows the message's full original transport headers. Colour categories, follow-up flags, importance, and sensitivity show as chips, and `winmail.dat` (TNEF) and S/MIME signed messages are unpacked to reveal their real body and attachments.
- **Attachment previews**: images, PDF, text/code, audio, video, nested emails, **spreadsheets** (`.xlsx/.xls/.csv/.ods`), and **Word** (`.docx`). Anything else is one-click downloadable.
- **Every Outlook item type**: contacts (name, emails, phones, company, addresses, birthday, notes), distribution lists (with members), calendar appointments (time, location, organizer, attendees), tasks (status, due date, % complete), journal entries, and sticky notes all render as cards, so nothing shows up blank.
- **Fast search** across all mailboxes: subjects, senders, recipients, body text, and attachment names. Words are typo-tolerant (fuzzy); numbers and reference codes are matched **exactly**, so an ID search stays precise. Wrap text in double quotes to search for that exact phrase (`"annual report"` finds only mail containing those words together, not mail mentioning each apart). Matches are highlighted in the open email and it scrolls to the first hit.
- **Export**: save a single email as **PDF** or as its original **`.eml`** (preserving the real headers and attachments), or merge several emails into one PDF (oldest-first or newest-first).
- **Offline PWA**: works with no connection after first load, and is installable.

## Run it

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (only for the dev/build step; the shipped app is plain static files).

```bash
npm install        # first time only
npm run dev        # development at http://localhost:5173
```

To build the production app and preview it (this is the real offline/installable version):

```bash
npm run build      # outputs static files to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the build at http://localhost:4173
```

## Deploy

The build is a static site, so you can host the contents of `dist/` on any static host (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, or any web server). No backend required. Once a visitor loads it, the service worker caches it for offline use.

A prebuilt **Docker image** is published automatically to `ghcr.io/bod09/pst-viewer` on every release — one `docker compose up`, no Node or build step, hardened by default (non-root, read-only, CSP).

See [DEPLOY.md](DEPLOY.md) for all options: GitHub Pages, Docker, Caddy (`npm run deploy` assembles a drop-in `deploy/` folder), Nginx, Netlify/Vercel/Cloudflare, and object storage.

## Privacy

There is no server. When you open a file, the browser reads it **directly from your disk** (in small slices, so even multi-gigabyte mailboxes work) and all parsing, rendering, search, and PDF export happen on your device. Your mailbox is never uploaded. Like a normal mail client, an email that references **remote images** will fetch those from the sender's servers when you view it (invisible tracking pixels are stripped, but a visible remote image can still tell the sender you opened it). Each remote image is fetched only once and then cached locally in your browser, so re-viewing it does not ping the sender again. Apart from that, the only network use is loading the app itself.

**Reopening a mailbox after a refresh (Chrome/Edge only):** if your browser supports the File System Access API, opening a `.pst`/`.ost` keeps a re-grantable handle to that file plus a cached copy of its extracted, plain-text search index (subjects, senders, body text) in this browser's local storage, so the mailbox and search reopen instantly instead of a full reindex. Nothing here is ever sent anywhere — it's the same local-only storage as the rest of the app — but it does mean this browser profile durably holds a handle to the file and plaintext extracted from your email bodies. Click "Forget" on a mailbox, or "Clear all local data," to erase it at any time; Firefox and Safari don't support this API, so they see no change from today's fully ephemeral behavior.

## Tech

React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind. PST parsing via [`@hiraokahypertools/pst-extractor`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hiraokahypertools/pst-extractor), `.msg` parsing via [`@kenjiuno/msgreader`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kenjiuno/msgreader), and `.eml` parsing via [`postal-mime`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postal-mime), all in a Web Worker. Search via MiniSearch, PDF rendering via pdf.js, spreadsheets via SheetJS, Word via docx-preview, zip handling via fflate, HTML sanitizing via DOMPurify, S/MIME (PKCS#7) parsing via node-forge. TNEF (winmail.dat) and MIME are parsed in-house. PWA via vite-plugin-pwa (Workbox).

## Known limitations

- **PowerPoint (`.pptx`/`.ppt`)** and **OpenDocument text (`.odt`)** attachments are download-only (no reliable in-browser renderer).
- **Encrypted S/MIME** messages can't be read without the recipient's private key (signed S/MIME is decoded and shown).
- **Corrupt or damaged mailboxes**: a partly-damaged file still opens and shows everything that is readable; messages that cannot be parsed are skipped and counted (a "N messages could not be read" note appears on the affected folder). A badly damaged file (broken header, truncated, or damaged internal index) cannot be opened at all: this is a read-only viewer, not a repair tool. To recover one of those, repair it first with Microsoft's free Inbox Repair Tool (`scanpst.exe`, bundled with Outlook), then open the repaired copy here. Either way, other loaded mailboxes keep working.
- Search becomes available for a mailbox once its background indexing finishes (a progress indicator is shown).
